### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile. well! I am Ashwak Syed. I am in 4th year of my B. Tech program from the Computer Science and Engineering branch. I am a fresher and I like Backend Development. I want to specify that it's not my only skill but rather the main one.
My skills include Java, HTML, CSS,C, and Python. I like to explore a little more every day about the new features of programming languages and I don't refuse challenges. that's basically what I can tell you about myself



- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack Development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on GitHub
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on ashwak@catalys.co
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
